I'm a marketing and SEO professional with a knack for crafting impactful digital campaigns and compelling content. With over six years of experience, I've honed my skills in copywriting, SEO, and email marketing to deliver measurable results for brands of all kinds. Whether it's writing persuasive copy, optimizing web content, or managing large email campaigns, I bring a blend of creativity and analytical rigor to every project.

Beyond the digital realm, I'm an avid sports fan, particularly passionate about supporting the Sacramento Kings and hitting the golf course whenever I can. My love for exploring new ideas extends to my favorite bits of pop culture, like the sci-fi novel "Way Station" by Simak or <em>Severance</em> on Apple TV. I find inspiration in travel and nature, which fuels my drive for continuous learning and improvement in both my professional and personal pursuits.

And you can always find me with my cats, Oliver (crazy orange cat) and Brock (normal).</p>
